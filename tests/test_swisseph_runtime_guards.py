"""Runtime guards for Swiss Ephemeris calls that were previously unprotected.

Two sibling call sites compute Swiss Ephemeris houses, but only one was guarded:
``_swisseph_angles`` wraps ``swe.houses_ex`` and degrades to the offline angle
engine, while ``_relative_house_layout`` (used by *every* core/relative chart
with a quadrant house system) called ``swe.houses_ex`` bare. A runtime swisseph
failure there leaked a raw, low-level error.

Per the project's fail-loud stance, a quadrant house system that swisseph cannot
compute must NOT silently degrade — ``_build_houses`` would anchor the cusps on
the ascendant and keep the "placidus" label, faking an approximation. So the
guard re-raises a *clear* error instead.

``_planetary_hours`` is different: ``None`` is its documented "unavailable"
contract, so a ``swe.revjul`` failure there degrades to ``None`` rather than
crashing the whole chart.
