"""Offline (no-swisseph) charts must honor the configured house system.

Regression for the bug where the approximate fallback silently degraded the
``equal_mc`` house system (10th cusp = MC, swisseph code ``D``) into plain
``equal`` houses anchored on the ascendant. That mislabeled the system *and*
shifted every planet by a house whenever the ascendant and ``MC + 90°`` fall in
different signs.

The birth below is entirely synthetic — chosen only because its ascendant and
``MC + 90°`` land in different signs, which is exactly the configuration that
exposes the bug.
