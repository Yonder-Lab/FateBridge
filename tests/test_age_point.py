"""年龄推进点 / Age Point (Huber) — verified by the technique's geometric invariants.

星阙/horosa computes Age Point in a closed backend with no readable source and no
golden fixture, so — unlike 波斯向运 — there is no byte-oracle to lock against. The
Huber technique is, however, fully public and geometrically determined: the point
leaves the Ascendant, sweeps the 12 Koch houses 6 years apiece, and returns to the
Ascendant after 72 years. We verify exactly those invariants on a synthetic chart
(exact cusps, so the assertions are exact) plus a real end-to-end cast.
