"""
Lightweight runtime metadata helpers for REST and MCP responses.

``tool_name`` is supplied authoritatively by the transport from the central
``ToolSpec`` (``spec.run_metadata_name``), so it is never inferred from payload
shape. This module only stamps the metadata envelope and detects the runtime
engine that produced a result.
